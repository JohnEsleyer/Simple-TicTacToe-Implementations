# TicTacToe-Implementations
A collection of simple TicTacToe implementations in various languages.

### Project Type: Educational
This project is solely for educational purposes. Some of the codes in this repository were not created by myself (They came from following video tutorials, blogs, and books). The goal of this project is to learn the mental process that goes into how other people write code and to increase my knowledge of best practices and software design patterns.
