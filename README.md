# TicTacToe-Implementations
A collection of TicTacToe implementations

### Project Type: Educational
This project is for my own educational purpose only. I did not design some of the codes stored in this repository (They came from video tutorials and books). The purpose of this project is to learn the thought process behind how other people write code. By looking at how others have tackled coding challenges, I can better understand different approaches and develop my own problem-solving skills. In addition, by studying other peoples' code, I can improve my understanding of best practices and software design patterns.
